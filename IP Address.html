    <h1 class="text-center"><i><b>IP Addresses</b></i></h1>
    <hr>
    <p class="text-justify"><b>What is IP Address?</b><br>IP address stands for Internet Protocol Address. IP Address is an identifying number that is associated with a specific computer system or computer network. When connected to the internet, the IP address allows the computers to send and receive information through any network type. There are four types of IP addresses: public, private, static, and dynamic. An IP address allows information to be sent and received by the correct parties, which means they can also be used to track down a user's physical location.</p>
    <p class="text-justify"><b>How IP works?</b><br>There are four different types of IP addresses: public, private, static, and dynamic.<br>Public and Private are understood by their names itself, but a static address also does not change and is manually created, whereas a dynamic IP address has been assigned by a Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) server and is subject to change. Dynamic IP addresses are the most common type of internet protocol addresses. Dynamic IP addresses are only active for a certain amount of time, after which they expire. The computer will either automatically request a new lease, or the computer may receive a new IP address.<br>An IP address can be compared to a SSN, since each one is completely unique to the computer or user it is assigned to. The creation of these numbers allows routers to identify where they are sending information on the internet. They also make sure that the correct devices are receiving what is being sent. Much like the post office needs a mailing address to deliver a package, a router needs an IP address to deliver to the web address requested.</p>
    <p class="text-justify"><b>IP versions:</b> There are two versions of IP in use today, IPv4 and IPv6. The original IPv4 protocol is still used today on both the internet, and many corporate networks. However, the IPv4 protocol only allowed for 232 addresses. So, later on, IPv6 was developed by IETF, and was formalized in 1998.</p>

    <p class="text-justify"><b>IPv4 addresses</b><br>IPv4 IP address are 32 bit numbers. In the above binary format, there are total of 32 binary numbers. Each and every binary number that are separated by the dot is converted to its corresponding binary number. There are total of 4 bytes here. Each and every octet can have a value from 0 to 255. Since there are 4 octets in an ip-address, the total possible combination of unique ipv4 ip addresses are 4,294,967,296.</p>

    <p class="text-justify"><b>IPv6 addresses</b><br>IPv6 stands for Internet Protocol Version 6. Since there is a possibility that we might run out of ip address in the internet, IPv6 was developed. IPv6 ip address has 128 bits. This is a huge improvement from the 32 bit ipv4 ip address. While lot of networks are getting configured for both IPv4 and IPv6, there is still a huge number of networks and systems in the internet that works only for IPv4. But eventually all these systems might go towards the IPv6 route.</p>
