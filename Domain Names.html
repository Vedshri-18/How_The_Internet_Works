    <p class="text-justify">Domain names were created to make IP or Internet Protocol Addresses more human-friendly. We can explain IP address as a unique set of numbers that is assigned to every computer connected to the Internet. Think of IP addresses like any regular street addresses. IP Addresses identify where an Internet-Connected-Computer is located on the Internet and help route information, so that, it can easily travel between computers. But IP addresses aren't practically rememberable. Like seriously? Who would remember multiple strings of random number with dots between them and eventually you don't know where to place them? As a conclusion, these combination of numbers and dots won't be on your tongue very easily. So why not name them?</p>
    <p class="text-justify">So, to solve this issue, DOMAIN NAMES become a hero here. While computers require IP addresses to locate one another, we humans can use domain names. The Domain Name System, or DNS, takes domain names, the kind of web addresses that people understand like google.com and translates them into IP addresses that computers need to communicate with. So instead of having to remember XX.XX.XXX.XXX (particular numbers used), you can simply remember google.com. Looks good and makes sense? Okay!</p>
    <p class="text-justify">When Internet users type a particular domain name into a web browser, the browser uses that particular domain name to find the correct IP address and, in turn, passes back the website associated with the respective associated IP address. Let us think it this way, a domain name functions like the contacts one stores in one's mobile phone. When one touches the name of a contact, that is stored in the mobile phone. That mobile phone automatically dials the number one has saved for that contact. One does not need to know where the person being called is located, and one does not even need to enter his/her specific phone number. All one has to do is touch the contact and mobile phone does the rest.</p>
    <p class="text-center"><b>Remember, domain names provide you with a simple, human-friendly way to locate websites on the Internet.</b></p>
    <h6 class="text-center">For example, in case of www.google.com, we can see that, <b>“google” is the Domain Name</b> and <b>.com is the Top Level Domain</b></h6>
    <br><p class="text-justify"><b>Let us now understand domain names in detail using the image below.</b></p>

    <br><p class="text-center"><b>The above image shows the parts of the domain name in detail</b></p>

    <br>
    <br><h5 class="text-center">Let us consider an example of "https://mom.me/food/666-10-spider-cookies-halloween/".</h5>
    <br><p class="text-justify">Let us not confuse Uniform Resource Locator (URL) with Domain Names because URL points to a location of the particular file only on the web. It can be any media such as image/video or any document as well. URL also provides information on, which format it should be presented in.</p>
    <br><p class="text-justify"><b>https://</b> represents a transfer protocol and directs how data will be transferred from a webpage to any browser, which can be cross-platform.</p>
    <br><p class="text-justify"><b>mom.me</b> is the domain name used here. Here we can see that, whatever comes after the dot in a domain name is a domain extension (.me)</p>
    <br><p class="text-justify"><b>/food/</b> is the directory or folder. It lets us know that this post belongs to the food category. We can say that, everything after domain name is used to identify the location of the desired content within the site.</p>
    <br><p class="text-justify"><b>/666-10-spider-cookies-halloween/</b> are the strings of numbers and alphabets, we can also call it alphanumeric, which comes last, locate the mentioned post.</p>
    <br>
    <h5 class="text-left"><b>Explanation of Domain Names</b></h5><br>
    <p class="text-justify"><b>TLD(Top Level Domains)</b> is exactly what it sounds like: a type of domain name which is at the top level of the internet’s domain name system. For example, .com, .org, .net, and .edu. The official list is maintained by IANA.</p>
    <p class="text-justify"><b>ccTLD(Country Code Top Level Domains)</b> use just two letters and are based upon international country codes, such as .in for India and.us for the United States. They’re often used by companies that are building dedicated sites for specific regions and can be a good way of signaling to users that they’ve arrived at the right place.</p>
    <p class="text-justify"><b>gTLD(Generic Top Level Domain)</b> is essentially a top-level domain that doesn’t rely on a country code. Many gTLDs are intended for a specific use-case, such as .edu which is aimed at educational institutions. </p>
    <p class="text-justify"><b>Second-Level Domains</b> is a domain that sits directly below a top-level domain name. For example, British companies occasionally use .co.uk instead of .com, and it’s a perfect example of a second-level domain. Another second-level domain is .gov.uk, which is often used by governmental institutions.</p>
    <p class="text-justify"><b>Subdomains</b> are useful because they don’t require webmasters to purchase an additional domain name to create divisions within their site. Instead, they’re able to create a subdomain that effectively points to a specific directory on the server. This can be essential for campaign sites and other types of web content that should be kept separate from the main site. For example, support.google.com.</p>
